/**
 * This script is a temporary solution for a common issue with monorepos, `changeset`, and `yarn workspaces`.
 * When publishing packages, workspace-protocol dependencies (e.g., "workspace:*") in `package.json`
 * files need to be replaced with the specific version number being published. While `changeset`
 * attempts to do this, this script provides an explicit override to ensure correctness.
 *
 * It's designed to be run AFTER `changeset version` and BEFORE `changeset publish`.
 *
 * --- How it works ---
 * 1.  It uses `yarn workspaces list` to get all packages in the monorepo.
 * 2.  For each package, it reads its `package.json` to find its current version.
 *     (This is why it must run after `changeset version` has bumped the versions).
 * 3.  It builds a map of all workspace package names to their new versions (e.g., `{ "@mcp-monorepo/shared": "1.1.1" }`).
 * 4.  It then re-iterates through each package's `package.json`.
 * 5.  It inspects `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies`.
 * 6.  If it finds a dependency that is another package in the workspace, it overwrites
 *     its version with the exact version from the map created in step 3.
 * 7.  The updated `package.json` content is written back to the file.
 *
 * --- CI/Workflow Integration ---
 * In a CI pipeline (like GitHub Actions), this script would be part of the publishing command.
 * For example, you could add the following scripts to your root `package.json`:
 *
 * "scripts": {
 *   ...
 *   "cs:prepare-publish": "node scripts/update-workspace-versions.js",
 *   "cs:publish": "yarn cs:prepare-publish && changeset publish"
 * }
 *
 * The `changesets/action` would then use `publish: yarn cs:publish`.
 *
 * The file modifications are temporary for the publish process. In a CI environment,
 * they are discarded when the runner is destroyed. For local publishing, you might
 * want to revert the changes afterwards using `git checkout -- "packages/_**_/package.json"`.
