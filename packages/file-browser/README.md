![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.4-blue) ![repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/monorepo-source-blue?logo=github&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCaesar2011%2Fmcp-monorepo%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fpackages%2Ffile-browser)

MCP server for file system browsing and manipulation (search, ls, tree, grep, open, write, move, mkdir)

This package provides a comprehensive set of tools for an AI agent to interact with a local file system. It enables operations such as reading, writing, patching, and moving files, as well as creating, listing, and removing directories. For security, all operations are strictly sandboxed within a user-defined working directory.

### Key Features

- **Secure Sandboxing**: All file system access is restricted to the directory specified by the `WORKING_DIR` environment variable, preventing unintended access to other parts of the system.
- **Comprehensive File Operations**: Includes tools for creating, reading, writing, patching, moving, and deleting files and directories.
- **Advanced Search & Replace**: A powerful `find-or-replace` tool that supports multi-line, case-sensitive regular expressions across multiple files.
- **Fuzzy Context Patching**: The `patch-file` tool can intelligently apply changes to a file using approximate line numbers and context matching, making it resilient to minor code shifts.
- **Rich Directory Traversal**: Provides both a flat `list-directory` view and a nested `tree-directory` view, with options for filtering by depth and regular expressions.
- **.gitignore Aware**: Directory traversal tools automatically respect `.gitignore` files, ensuring that ignored files and folders are excluded from results.


## Usage

You can run this MCP server directly using npx for local testing:

```bash
npx @mcp-monorepo/file-browser@latest
```

To integrate this server with a compatible AI model (like Claude), provide the following MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@mcp-monorepo/file-browser"
      ],
      "env": {
        "WORKING_DIR": "<Your WORKING_DIR Here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `WORKING_DIR` | The absolute path to the root directory that the file browser is sandboxed to. All file operations will be constrained within this path. | `<required>` |

## Tools

### `open-file`

**Open File** - Opens a file by its relative filepath and returns its content.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `filepath` | `string` |  |


---

### `write-file`

**Write File** - Create or completely overwrite a file with new content. Creates parent directories if they don't exist.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `filepath` | `string` |  |
| `content` | `string` | Content to write to the file |


---

### `move-path`

**Move Path** - Moves files or directories to new locations. Each source must exist, and each target must not.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `paths` | `array of object` |  |


---

### `list-directory`

**List Directory Contents** - Lists the contents of a directory with details.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dirpath` | `string` | Relative path to the directory. Defaults to current working directory. |


---

### `tree-directory`

**Tree Directory Contents** - Generates a nested JSON representation with optional filtering of the directory contents.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dirpath` | `string` | Relative path to the tree root directory. Defaults to current working directory. |
| `depth` | `number` | Maximum depth to traverse |
| `regexp` | `string` | Only relative paths in unix style (e.g. "dir/to/file.txt") matching this regexp (e.g. "to/.*\.txt") will be returned. |


---

### `mk-dir`

**Make Directory** - Creates a directory and all necessary parent directories recursively.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dirpath` | `string` |  |


---

### `remove-file`

**Remove File** - Removes a file or directory. For directories, removes recursively including all contents.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `filepath` | `string` |  |


---

### `find-or-replace`

**Find or Replace Text in Files** - Search for text patterns in files with optional replacement. Supports multi-line matches and provides context.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dirpath` | `string` | Relative path to search directory. Defaults to current working directory. |
| `fileRegexp` | `string` | Regexp to filter file paths (e.g. ".*\.ts$" for TypeScript files). |
| `searchRegexp` | `string` | Regexp pattern to search for in file contents. Can span multiple lines. The flags "gms" will be used. |
| `replaceString` | `string` | Replacement string. Use $1, $2, etc. for capture groups. If provided, performs replacement instead of showing matches. |


---

### `patch-file`

**Patch File** - Apply a patch to a file by replacing content between approximate start and end line numbers with context matching. Provide at least one line of unmodified content before and after the change.

**Input Schema**

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `path` | `string` |  |
| `patch` | `string` |  |
| `approxStartLine` | `integer` | Approximate start line number of the patch |
