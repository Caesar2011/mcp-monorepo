This package provides a set of powerful geospatial tools for the Model Context Protocol, powered by the [Stadia Maps API](https://stadiamaps.com/). It enables models to perform tasks like geocoding addresses, calculating routes, generating isochrones, fetching timezone information, and creating static map images.

### Key Features

- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses and place names into geographic coordinates and vice-versa, with both single and bulk lookup capabilities.
- **Routing**: Calculate travel time, distance, and route geometry between multiple points for various travel modes (car, bike, pedestrian).
- **Isochrones**: Generate reachable areas (polygons) from a point based on time or distance constraints.
- **Timezone Lookup**: Get detailed timezone information, including offsets and current local time, for any coordinate.
- **Rate-Limited**: All API calls are automatically throttled to respect API usage limits.
<!-- - **Static Maps**: Create PNG map images, with options to overlay routes (polylines) and custom markers. -->
