The Location MCP Server provides tools to determine geographic information based on an IP address. It can find the location for a user-provided IP or automatically detect the server's own public IP address to find its current location.

### Key Features

- **Current Location Detection**: Automatically identifies the server's public IP address to provide its own location data.
- **IP-based Lookup**: Retrieves detailed geographic information for any valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- **Rich Data**: Returns comprehensive location details, including city, region, country, coordinates, timezone, and ISP information.
- **External Service Integration**: Utilizes `ipify.org` for public IP detection and `ip-api.com` for geolocation data.
