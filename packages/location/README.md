MCP server for location-based tools using IP address lookup

The Location MCP Server provides tools to determine geographic information based on an IP address. It can find the location for a user-provided IP or automatically detect the server's own public IP address to find its current location.

### Key Features

- **Current Location Detection**: Automatically identifies the server's public IP address to provide its own location data.
- **IP-based Lookup**: Retrieves detailed geographic information for any valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- **Rich Data**: Returns comprehensive location details, including city, region, country, coordinates, timezone, and ISP information.
- **External Service Integration**: Utilizes `ipify.org` for public IP detection and `ip-api.com` for geolocation data.


## Usage

You can run this MCP server directly using npx for local testing:

```bash
npx @mcp-monorepo/location@latest
```

To integrate this server with a compatible AI model (like Claude), provide the following MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "location": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@mcp-monorepo/location"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
